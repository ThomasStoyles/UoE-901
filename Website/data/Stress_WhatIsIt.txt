What is stress?
Stress is the body's reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure.
When we are stressed, our body releases a hormone called adrenaline (often called the "fight or flight" hormone), which usually gives us a boost or motivates us to act quickly.
But too much stress can affect our mood, our body and our relationships â€“ especially when it feels out of our control. It can make us feel anxious and irritable, and affect our self-esteem.
Experiencing long-term stress or severe stress can lead to feeling physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called "burnout"
