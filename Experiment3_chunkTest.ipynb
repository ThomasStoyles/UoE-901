      "This can be helpful in some situations, but it might also cause physical symptoms such as an increased heart rate and increased sweating. In some people, it might cause a panic attack.\n",

      "work – feeling pressure at work, unemployment or retirement\n",
      "family – relationship difficulties, divorce or caring for someone\n",
      "financial problems – unexpected bills or borrowing money\n",
      "health – illness, injury or losing someone (bereavement)\n",
      "difficult past experiences – bullying, abuse or neglect\n",
